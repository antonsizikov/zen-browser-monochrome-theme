# [Monochrome](https://zen-browser.app/themes/11d685eb-4515-4045-864b-0a50589f8a4d) theme for [Zen Browser](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop)

There is no monochrome option in theme settings, so i created this theme.

- No distracting colours, only grayscale.
- No outline border on tabs.
- Window outline border slightly dimmed.
- Supports Light and Dark mode.
